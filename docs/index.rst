D-LIM: Hypothesis-driven interpretable neural network for interactions between genes
=================================================================================

MAVE-NN [#dlim_2024]_ enables the automatic modeling of phenotype-fitness maps from the data. This problem is then solved by training a neural network using a PyTorch backend. 
To learn more about this modeling, please see our manuscript.
